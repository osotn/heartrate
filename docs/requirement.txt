This document describes main requirements on arm heart rate
simple device that consists from android phone mounted on arm, arduino
device mounted on wrist, and heart rate sensor mounted on little finger of arm.

1. Sensor is a small Optical sensor of heart rate (and oxygen level) that
   toughly connected to a little finger and outputs signal via analog or I2C/SPI
   interface to arduino device (up to 10 cm);
2. Arduino is micro arduino device that receives signal from the sensor and
   outputs data in text form (e.g., "{200}, {3500}, "} to Android telephone 
   via usb-uart or bluetooth interfaces.
3. Phone is An android phone that receives text form data from arduino device
   and shows it in as GUI application and provide corresponsing audio signal
   to user via headphone (text to voice service).

Application on the phone can use data from GPS and Acceleration sensors
on the phone (and possible acceleration sensor that connected to arduino
device).

The first mock-up (prototype) device is going to be implemented as
usb-connection between the Phone and Arduino device (OTG USB, that provide
USB-COMport connection and power supply).
